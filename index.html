				Project Idea<br><br></span>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: medium">
				With the hustle and bustle of home automation a potential 
				project idea I have stems from home automation, as an avid 
				motorcyclist after coming home for a long ride there is always 
				that awkward moment when approaching the garage door just to 
				fumble around the pockets to find the remote. My project idea is 
				to implement a device or devices that work together to safely 
				open the garage door allowing access without the need for a 
				separate remote, I believe it will make a significant impact of 
				motorcyclists or motorists alike.<o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: medium">
				The motivation for this project lies in the fact that most 
				households will have some sort of vehicle, In 1996 the world was 
				home to roughly around 670 Million vehicles and growing. Source:
				<span class="auto-style2">

				https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-advice/how-many-cars-are-there-in-the-world-70629</a></span> 
				although a more favoured personal project of mine I think if it 
				ever comes to fruition it would serve greatly with ease as to 
				how it could conveniently remove a manual process in one’s life. 
				My idea lies in utilising some existing products but combining 
				them into a all in one project (Raspberry Pi, infrared sensors, 
				geofencing or Bluetooth activation) with home automation in 
				style and trending I am very certain that this project may be of 
				interests to others.<o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style1">The idea behind 
				this project is that, it is simply a smart garage opener, 
				however with a more comprehensive package, an all in one 
				solution it can detect a user in range via geofencing or 
				wireless network detection activation or even Bluetooth, that’s 
				the activation trigger side of things, now on to the safety 
				aspect, being automated some safety measures must be in place to 
				maintain safety and well being to those around us, should the 
				garage opener detect an obstacle or vehicle present it will 
				carry out certain functions that are all programmable. On top of 
				this we could also implement the use of smart assistants to 
				carry out simple functions e.g.: Hey Siri, or ok google. The 
				service of this product lies in the convenience factor, whereby 
				vehicles can leave and enter a premise with a door opening as 
				you arrive or close when you leave. </span> <o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style1">The hardware and 
				software side of things can vary but there are some obvious 
				choices available. A raspberry Pi is an ideal node on the 
				wireless network as it is cheap and not much computing 
				processing is required, other items required are a reed switch 
				in which will detect the open or closed state of the door. 
				Software side we can definitely side with either Homebridge.io 
				or Hass.io.</span><span class="auto-style2"> <o:p></o:p></p>
				</span></strong><span>Should the project be successful, the 
				outcome will be an all in one plug and play solution to an 
				extension of a smart home automation accessory which inevitably 
				will make some lives a lot easier for motorists. With all the 
				gizmos and gadgets out there already, this project will make it 
				easier for general users who are not technically inclined to 
				have a product that works from the box rather than a DIY 
				solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></td>
